Par for the Course — Scorekeeping App

by Promethean Games LLC
“Play. Learn. Connect.”

Overview

Par for the Course (PftC) is a modern scorekeeping web app built for billiards enthusiasts who want to bring structure, challenge, and creativity to their game. Designed by actual pool players, the app is a companion to the physical Par for the Course card game — combining skill drills, friendly competition, and on-table strategy into one seamless experience.

This app allows players to track scores, manage rosters, and progress through 18 unique course cards, each designed to test cue ball control, shot selection, and pattern play. With clean UI/UX, offline functionality, and real-time state saving, the Par for the Course Scorekeeper delivers a smooth experience wherever you play.

Features
Dynamic Scoreboard: Track multiple players with real-time updates.
Game Progression: Automatically gate the next card until all players have posted a score.
Cross-Device Transfer: Generate or scan a unique QR code to transfer game data (for captain handoffs or backup devices).
Offline Persistence: All progress is saved locally and reloads automatically.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
UI Framework: Custom
Data Handling: Local Storage + QR Code JSON transfer
Build Philosophy: Data Driven 'User Journeys'
Versioning: Semantic (vFrontEnd.UI.UX.DebugCode)
